# Requirements
To be able to start the application please make sure that MSSQL local database is installed on your system. To add the database open Visual Studio and perform the following steps:
- Open Server Explorer under the View tab
- Add a database
- Change data source to Microsoft SQL Server database file (SqlClient)
- For the database file select the Database2.mdf file located in the database folder
- Click on OK to add the database
- Now ensure in the SQL Server Object Explorer that the database is named 'Session3'. If this is not the case you should change the name.

# Starting the application
For starting the application navigate to the Executable/net9.0-windows10.0.19041.0/win10-x64 folder and double-click the _runMe.exe file.

# Important notes
For each booking a user is needed. The first passenger in the list is taken as User. If the user does not exist yet in the User table of the database (based on firstname, lastname and birthdate -> only possible way to check for existance since mail address not present for booking) then the User is created and added with empty email and password (empty string not null!).
